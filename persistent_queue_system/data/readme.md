# Data Folder - Persistent Queue System

## Overview
The `data` folder is used to store files generated by the **producer** in the Persistent Queue System. These files represent jobs submitted to the queue and are processed by the **consumer**.

## Contents
- **Generated Files:**
  - Files created by the producer with random names (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.txt`).
  - Each file contains sample data (e.g., `Sample data`).

- **Processed Files:**
  - After processing by the consumer, files are updated with timestamps (e.g., `1698765432.123456: Sample data`).

## Usage
1. **Producer:**
   - The producer generates files and stores them in the `data` folder.
   - Example:
     ```python
     file_path = f"data/{uuid.uuid4()}.txt"
     with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
         f.write("Sample data")
     ```

2. **Consumer:**
   - The consumer reads files from the `data` folder, processes them, and updates their content.
   - Example:
     ```python
     with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
         lines = f.readlines()
     with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
         for line in lines:
             f.write(f"{time.time()}: {line}")
     ```

## Notes
- Ensure the `data` folder exists before running the producer. You can create it manually or programmatically:
  ```python
  import os
  os.makedirs("data", exist_ok=True)
