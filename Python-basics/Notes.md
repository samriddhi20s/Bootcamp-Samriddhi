# Python Basics Notes

## Understanding the Task
The objective was to practice Python fundamentals, including working with classes, objects, data structures, decorators, and lambda functions. The module also covered writing and organizing Python code efficiently.

## Approach
1. Practiced basic drills to understand Python's working.
2. Worked with classes and objects, creating and using methods.
3. Implemented different data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
4. Explored and used decorators and lambda functions for concise and functional programming.
5. Dove deeper into creating and organizing classes.

## Problems Faced

### Issue: Syntax Errors in Class Definitions
While defining a class and initializing attributes, encountered an indentation error and incorrect use of `self`.

**Solution:** Fixed indentation and correctly used `self` for instance attributes.

### Issue: Lambda Functions Not Returning Expected Output
Lambda functions were not behaving as expected, especially in filtering lists.

**Solution:** Used `map()` and `filter()` functions properly and debugged with `print()`.

### Issue: Using Decorators
Faced difficulty understanding how decorators modify function behavior dynamically.

**Solution:** Practiced with multiple decorator functions and reviewed ChatGPT examples.

## What I Learned
- Properly defining and using Python classes and objects.
- Efficient use of lambda functions in list processing.
- How decorators enhance function behavior dynamically.
- Memory-efficient handling of large data structures.

## ChatGPT Assistance
ChatGPT helped by:
- Explaining Python class structures and common pitfalls.
- Providing working examples of decorators and lambda functions.
- Helping debug syntax and logical errors in data structures.
- Suggesting efficient ways to handle large data structures in memory.
